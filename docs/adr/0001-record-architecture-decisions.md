# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2026-01-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences

*   We will have a record of important decisions.
*   New developers will understand the "why" behind the architecture.
*   We can see the evolution of the system.
